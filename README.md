# An Android App that allows users to add notes, delete notes, and edit notes
  Utilizes Room Database and SQL Queries to store the notes inside the app in a structured way
  The primary components of my Room are: the notes database class(which connects to a database and holds it), the Note entity, and my Note Dao(Data Access Object)
  I also integrate an Alert Dialog where when a User clicks on the note, it allows them to Edit them and Delete them, which edits and deletes from the database accordingly
